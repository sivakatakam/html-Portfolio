<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Siva Katakam, an enthusiastic learner who loves exploring how things work — whether it’s coding, embedded systems, PCB designing, or web development. I enjoy turning ideas into reality through practical projects and creative solutions. I believe that curiosity and consistency are my biggest strengths, and I’m always ready to take on new challenges to grow my skills.</p>

<p>Over the past year, I’ve been actively working on developing my knowledge in embedded systems, Arduino programming, and PCB design, while also diving into web development and cybersecurity. I enjoy combining hardware and software to build real-world solutions, like using sensors and microcontrollers for automation or security projects. My approach is hands-on: I like learning by doing and improving through experimentation.</p>

<p>Beyond my technical interests, I love sharing what I learn and collaborating with others who have the same passion for innovation. I believe in continuous learning and helping others along the way. Through this portfolio, I hope to showcase my projects, my journey, and connect with like-minded people who want to make ideas happen. Thanks for visiting my page — let’s keep building and learning together!</p>
